# Cleaning my data
* In workbench I looked through my data, specifically under the headings "school name" and "school type" for errors/anomolies and didnt find any.
* I then opened the data in google sheets and expanded it so that all the headings and data is visible and user-friendly.
* I included an additional row at the bottom labelled â€œTotal.
* Although the figures appear to be numerical with currency value, they are actually captured in the table as hard coded text. In order to convert these figures into actual numbers the $ sign needs to be removed. 
* Once this is done, to return the $ sign reminding me that we are working with currency, the cells need to be formatted by selecting currency as USD
* I have now cleaned my data
